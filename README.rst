Introduction 
=======================
This repository is for students to get access to the `ECE744` Lab materials. 

Directory Structure
=======================
  - BoardSupportPackages: This is to install the board support packages for the NEXYS DDR4 board for VIVADO software tool. Follow the instruction in https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/installing-vivado/start
  - Documents: These are some very useful documentations for the lab
  - Labs_CheatSheet: Contains code for the labs
  - VHDL Modules: Useful VHDL modules that can be used in the lab
  - FIRfilter: For those who are already familiar with the FPGA and VHDL, you can follow the README.rst in this folder.

Labs
======================
These are short introduction of each lab.

lab 1
----------
In this lab, you will design and build a simple code converter circuit using the Nexys 4 DDR Development board, which is designed around the Xilinx Artix-7. During this laboratory, you will gain experience using the Xilinx Vivado digital circuit development tools.

Requirement: Successfully running the code provide in https://github.com/bwang40/ECE744_LabMaterials/tree/master/Labs_CheatSheet/Lab1

lab 2
----------
In this lab, you will design and program a four-bit ripple-carry adder/subtractor circuit using modular design techniques.  All of the necessary VHDL coding concepts and procedures will be introduced in the laboratory and implemented by the experimenter.

Requirement: Complete the code provided in https://github.com/bwang40/ECE744_LabMaterials/tree/master/Labs_CheatSheet/Lab2 and successfully run it on the FPGA board.

lab 8
----------
In this lab, you will learn how to design Finite State Machines with VHDL. Typically, traffic light control is a field dominated by micro-controllers. Very complex timing of these lights can be handled with some simple software running on off-the-shelf products. For very simple traffic lights, however, it may be possible to implement their timing functionality with simple sequential logic circuits. In this lab, you will design and implement two traffic light controller circuits using the Nexys 4 DDR board.

Requirement: Complete the code provided in https://github.com/bwang40/ECE744_LabMaterials/tree/master/Labs_CheatSheet/Lab8 and successfully run it on the FPGA board.


lab 9
----------
This laboratory experiment will introduce some concepts of data encryption and cryptography that may be implemented using an FPGA and the Nexys 4 DDR board. The student will then be given a set of encrypted ASCII text and will decrypt it using the methods specified in this experiment.

Requirement: Complete the code provided in https://github.com/bwang40/ECE742_LabMaterials/tree/master/Labs_CheatSheet/Lab9 and successfully run it on the FPGA board.


Lab Report
======================
You have to submit a lab report for these four labs through blackboard. The lab report has to include the following sections:

     * Introduction
     * procedures
     * Results
     * Discussion/Conclusion
     * Reference
     * Appendix(code and screenshots)

Academic Honesty
========================
You must acknowledge your work including figures, codes and writings are belonging to you with your signature on the front page of all submitted reports. If any similarity in the code, comments, customized program behavior, report writings and/or figures are found, both the helper (original work) and the requestor (duplicated/modified work) will be called for academic disciplinary action including failure of this course, and student's advisor/department will be notified.

Lab open Hours
========================
From March 2nd to March 27th, the lab SH310B will be open on weekdays except each Friday and spring break from 10am to 5pm. Please arrange your time wisely.
